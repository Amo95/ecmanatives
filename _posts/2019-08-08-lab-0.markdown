Lab number zero. That sounds a bit weird right? In this lab we're not going to
do to much. Instead I'll talk a bit about the history of the web, JavaScript,
some of the politics that created the community we have today and then I'll help
you setup an environment so we can start developing stuff in Lab one.

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('hello world')
{% endhighlight %}
